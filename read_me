Each event listener represents their respective html listener: rock,paper and scissor. As soon as player hits
a button i.e. rock, it stores the value 'rock' in a variable called playerMove. This variable is stored so that
it can be used to compare player moves with computer move later in the game.

At the same time, a function for computer selection is called each time the button is pressed and stored in computerMove
The reason I decided to go this route for storing computer moves is when i tried to do it outside the click event,
it would generate a different move each time I wanted to use the computerMove value because of random number generator.
Since this variable changes for only every click, I can reuse it to display the value to the user without it changing.

Other than that, each time the button is clicked, the text displayed on HTML document is reset to "" and thats that.

How did I implement the scoring system?

I initailized two variables at the beginning of the program:
let player_score = 0;
let computer_score = 0;

So everytime player won, I incremented player_score by 1:
function gameLogic(player, computer) {
  if (
    (player == 'rock' && computer == 'scissor') ||
    (player == 'paper' && computer == 'rock') ||
    (player == 'scissor' && computer == 'paper')
  ) {
    winnerText.textContent = 'Player Wins';
    player_score += 1;                                          <-------------- Here and then I called the score()
    score();                                                     function. Which appends score value to a span.
    console.log(1);
  } else if (
    (player == 'scissor' && computer == 'rock') ||
    (player == 'rock' && computer == 'paper') ||
    (player == 'paper' && computer == 'scissor')
  ) {
    winnerText.textContent = 'Computer Wins';
    computer_score += 1;
    score();
    console.log(2);
  } else {
    winnerText.textContent = 'Draw';
  }
}

function score() {
  playerScore.textContent = player_score;
  computerScore.textContent = computer_score;
}

To be completely honest with myself, I didn't expect it to work, I just wrote the code down and it somehow did.
I need to improve my thinking skills.

The game logic is simple. its just a bunch of if and conditional operands. The functions were hard to figure out.
But I am having alot of fun working on this project. It's been a  hell of a ride so far. And I'm really happy
with what I have worked out so far. Really happy with figuring out all this by myself. Still got alot of ideas 
and a long way to go (; Can't wait.
